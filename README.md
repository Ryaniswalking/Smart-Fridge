## 📋 Available Scripts

### Backend Scripts
- **`npm start`**: Start the server in production mode.
- **`npm run dev`**: Start the server in development mode (requires `nodemon`).

### Frontend Scripts
- **`npm start`**: Start the React development server.
- **`npm build`**: Build the app for production.

---

## 🌐 Proxy Setup
The React frontend is configured to proxy API requests to the backend. Update the `proxy` field in `frontend/package.json` if the backend port changes:
```json
"proxy": "http://localhost:5000"
```

---

## 🐞 Troubleshooting
- **Port in use**: If you encounter an `EADDRINUSE` error, change the port in `backend/index.js` or terminate the process using the port.
- **Dependency issues**: Run `npm install` in both `frontend` and `backend` directories.
